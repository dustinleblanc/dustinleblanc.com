Hi, I'm Dustin LeBlanc, a fullstack web developer with a passion for people, leadership, and calm, meaningful work. I write about getting into web development as an artist, leveraging ADHD, the art of coding, and anything else that feels important and relavent.

I have lots of opinions about stuff, mostly related to building supportive and encouraging work places, doing the right thing, building people up, and taking the road less traveled in your life, code, and career.

I am the co-founder of [Unrealist](https://unreal.ist), the chief engineer behind [Dropship](https://dropshipci.com), and a co-maintainer of [Lando](https://lando.dev).

I share a lot of my thoughts on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/DustinLeblanc) and the Unrealist blog, but occassionally I write longer pieces here.
